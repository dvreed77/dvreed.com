# dvreed.com - Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This site serves as a platform to showcase my projects and share my explorations through blog posts. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), it combines modern web technologies with a clean, efficient design.


## 🚀 Project Structure

The website is organized into two main sections:

1. **Projects** - A showcase of my technical projects and developments
2. **Explorations** - Blog posts where I dive deep into various topics
