Having lived in Massachusetts for over 20 years, I've always been curious about the various towns and their relationships to each other. I created this app as a way to test your knowledge of Massachusetts towns - simply type in as many as you can remember. I chose this approach because we often hear about different towns in the news or from friends without knowing exactly where they are. It's fascinating to discover how close these places are to towns you're already familiar with.
