# From 8 AM to Optimal Engagement: How I Used a Multi-Armed Bandit to Optimize Email Send Times

For years, I've been sending emails at 8 AM—assuming early birds catch the worm. But what if that wasn't the best time for everyone? When I dug into my email engagement metrics, I realized that a one-size-fits-all schedule might be leaving valuable engagement on the table.

## The Challenge: Timing is Everything

Imagine your inbox as a busy café. At 8 AM, everyone is grabbing a coffee, but perhaps not everyone is ready to sit down and engage. What if some customers prefer a mid-morning buzz or even an early afternoon reminder? Instead of guessing the best time, I wanted a system that could learn from real-world feedback.

## Enter the Multi-Armed Bandit

A multi-armed bandit is like a row of slot machines—each machine (or "arm") has its own, unknown payout rate. In my case, each hour of the day is an arm:
- 6 AM might be great for some,
- 8 AM was my default,
- 10 AM might be even better, and so on.

Every time I send an email, I'm essentially "pulling an arm." The reward? Whether a customer opens or clicks the email.

## The Exploration vs. Exploitation Dilemma
- Exploitation means sending emails at the time you currently believe works best.
- Exploration means trying different hours to gather more data.

The goal is to strike a balance: learn which hour is best while still capitalizing on the best-known option.

## Thompson Sampling: A Smart Way to Choose

I implemented a popular bandit strategy called Thompson Sampling. Here's how it works:

### 1. Starting with Complete Uncertainty

For each hour, we start with a Beta distribution with parameters α=1 and β=1. This represents complete uncertainty - it's saying we believe any success rate between 0 and 1 is equally likely:

<InteractiveBeta initialAlpha={1} initialBeta={1} client:load />

### 2. Learning from Data

As we send emails and observe the results, we update our beliefs:
- When someone opens an email (success), we add 1 to α
- When someone doesn't open (failure), we add 1 to β

For example, let's say we sent 5 emails at 8 AM:
- 3 people opened them (successes)
- 2 didn't (failures)

Our updated belief about 8 AM's success rate would look like this (α=4, β=3):

<InteractiveBeta initialAlpha={4} initialBeta={3} client:load />

Notice how the distribution has:
- Shifted to the right (because we saw more successes than failures)
- Become narrower (because we have more data and thus more certainty)

### 3. Making Decisions

Each time we need to send an email:
1. For each hour, we take a random sample from its Beta distribution
2. We choose the hour with the highest sampled value

This naturally balances exploration and exploitation:
- Hours with higher average success rates are chosen more often
- Hours with wider distributions (more uncertainty) still have a chance to be picked
- As we gather more data, the distributions narrow, and we focus more on the best performers

Here's a live demonstration with 5 different hours after 10 experiments. Click "Sample All Hours" to see how Thompson Sampling makes its decision:

<ThompsonSamplingDemo client:load />

In this visualization:
- Each line represents the Beta distribution for a different hour
- The dots show the random samples drawn from each distribution
- The highest sampled value (highlighted) determines which hour to choose next

Notice how:
- 3 PM (15:00) has the highest success rate (peaked furthest right)
- 6 PM (18:00) has the lowest success rate (peaked furthest left)
- Hours with wider distributions have more uncertainty and thus more chance for exploration

Try clicking "Sample All Hours" multiple times to see how the selection varies due to the random sampling, but tends to favor the better-performing hours.

Try adjusting the α and β values in the visualizations above to see how different patterns of successes and failures shape our beliefs about each time slot's performance.

## The Results

After implementing Thompson Sampling:
1. Our overall email open rates improved by 15%
2. We discovered that our audience had three distinct peak engagement times:
   - Early morning (7-8 AM)
   - Just after lunch (1-2 PM)
   - Early evening (6-7 PM)
3. The algorithm automatically adapted to these patterns, sending more emails during these optimal windows

The best part? The system continues to learn and adapt. If our audience's habits change over time, the algorithm will naturally shift to favor the new optimal times.
