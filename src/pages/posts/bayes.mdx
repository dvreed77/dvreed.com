Suppose you are given this description of Steve:

> Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with very little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.

Is Steve a _Farmer_ or a _Librarian_?

It is impossible to tackle this problem in a vacuum. You will undoubtedly need to use your past experiences and knowledge of the world.

## What is your Prior Knowledge?

Before you saw the description above, what do you know about librarians and farmers? Are there more librarians in the world than farmers?

If there were significantly more librarians in the world than farmers then using that knowledge would improve your chances of being correct.
