In November of 2019, I participated in my first Codevember where I created generative art every day for the month of November. I was particularly intriqued by K Tessellation as described [here][1] by John Green.

I wanted to create my own artwork, and was interested in developing my own drawing app to do this. This project is still a work in progress, but something I want to finish soon.
